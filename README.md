# Tweet-Scraper

A simple node app for retrieving an individual user's tweets using Twitter's advanced search.

The app retrieves the most recent Tweets, stores them in a local JSON file, and checks for new Tweets periodically. When a new Tweet is found, the body of the tweet is translated from the source language to the target language and emailed.

This was written as a joke among friends. Please do not abuse the Twitter search or Google Translate features.
